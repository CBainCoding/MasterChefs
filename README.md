<h3>Features</h3>
<h5>Navbar</h5>
Nav bar has a consistent look across all pages and links work. 
On larger screens it displays in full on smaller devices it switches to a dropdown menu for ease of use

<h5>Landing page</h5>
Landing page features links to highlighted recipes. In the future we would add search and filter functions to allow for more recipes without cluttering up the front page

<h5>Footer</h5>
The footer was intended to feature on all pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.  It contains four social media links (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube), so that users can access the Master Chefs social media output.

<h5>About Us</h5>
The About Us page gives the user more information about the chefs responsible for the recipes on the website - their backgrounds and vision for the site. The page was developed in accordance with the wireframe designs and includes an image of some of the chefs in action and an image of a tower viewfinder to match the contents of the paragraphs.
