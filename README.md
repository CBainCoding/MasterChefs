UX Designer - Esther Njoku

As the UX Designer at Master Chefs, with the aim of creating a seamless digital experience, I crafted user-friendly yet straightforward wireframe designs that leaves the user satisfied and their recipe-hunting goal accomplished. I wanted the user to easily understand what the website was about and be able to navigate the site with ease.

For the Main/Home Page I combined aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that every click and scroll enhances the user experience. I carefully orchestrated the website's layout to make it a joy to navigate, and made recipe discovery easy for users of all ages and backgrounds.

For the recipe search feature, I kept them all on the main page with high quality pictures so the user would have a visual representation of the recipe, while making that feature a link which leads to the full recipe page.

For users to be able to easily contact the website owners or to be a part of our wider community, I placed our multiple social media handles in the footer at the bottom of the page, represented by their respective icons.


For the colour scheme, the team decided on cooler, blue tones because research confirms that “Blue for a website colour scheme appeals to a wide range of demographics including people at a variety of ages. Blue conveys feelings of trust, loyalty, stability, confidence, and intelligence.” This aligns with our goals for this website and is a perfect fit aesthetically.

I also included an ‘About Us’ page which shares a little bit about the ‘chefs’ behind the website and recipes to create a sense of familiarity and relatability, this would cause the user to return to the website and maybe sign up to become a regular visitor.

Lastly I designed a mobile-phone friendly layout which would increase traffic to the page because phones are the most used medium for accessing the internet. I still kept the framework of using a picture of the food, with a clickable link that leads to the recipe.

The result? An immersive and user-friendly platform that attracts and services users with different needs and requirements. Cheers to a visually stunning and intuitively designed culinary adventure!
